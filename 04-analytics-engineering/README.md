## What is Analytics Engineering?

As the _data domain_ has developed over time, new tools have been introduced that have changed the dynamics of working with data:

![alt text](<../images/Screenshot from 2024-02-23 14-47-43.png>)

1. Massively parallel processing (MPP) databases
    * Lower the cost of storage 
    * BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift...
1. Data-pipelines-as-a-service
    * Simplify the ETL process
    * Fivetran, Stitch...
1. SQL-first / Version control systems
    * Looker...
1. Self service analytics
    * Mode...
1. Data governance


The introduction of all of these tools changed the way the data teams work as well as the way that the stakeholders consume the data, creating a gap in the roles of the data team. Traditionally:

![alt text](<../images/Screenshot from 2024-02-23 14-50-41.png>)
* The ***data engineer*** prepares and maintains the infrastructure the data team needs.
* The ***data analyst*** uses data to answer questions and solve problems (they are in charge of _today_).
* The ***data scientist*** predicts the future based on past patterns and covers the what-ifs rather than the day-to-day (they are in charge of _tomorrow_).


However, with the introduction of these tools, both data scientists and analysts find themselves writing more code even though they're not software engineers and writing code isn't their top priority.  Data engineers are good software engineers but they don't have the training in how the data is going to be used  by the business users.

The ***analytics engineer*** is the role that tries to fill the gap: it introduces the good software engineering practices to the efforts of data analysts and data scientists. The analytics engineer may be exposed to the following tools:
1. Data Loading (Stitch...)
1. Data Storing (Data Warehouses)
1. Data Modeling (dbt, Dataform...)
1. Data Presentation (BI tools like Looker, Mode, Tableau...)

## Data Modeling Concepts

### ETL vs ELT

In lesson 2 we covered the difference between [ETL and ELT](/02-workflow-orchestration/README.md).

![alt text](<../images/Screenshot from 2024-02-23 15-51-33.png>)

In this lesson we will cover the _transform_ step in the ELT process.

### Dimensional Modeling

[Ralph Kimball's Dimensional Modeling](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dimensional_modeling#:~:text=Dimensional%20modeling%20(DM)%20is%20part,use%20in%20data%20warehouse%20design.) is an approach to Data Warehouse design which focuses on 2 main points:
* Deliver data which is understandable to the business users.
* Deliver fast query performance.

Other goals such as reducing redundant data (prioritized by other approaches such as [3NF](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Third_normal_form#:~:text=Third%20normal%20form%20(3NF)%20is,integrity%2C%20and%20simplify%20data%20management.) by [Bill Inmon](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bill_Inmon)) are secondary to these goals. Dimensional Modeling also differs from other approaches to Data Warehouse design such as [Data Vaults](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Data_vault_modeling).

Dimensional Modeling is based around 2 important concepts:
* ***Fact Table***:
    * _Facts_ = _Measures_
    * Typically numeric values which can be aggregated, such as measurements or metrics.
        * Examples: sales, orders, etc.
    * Corresponds to a [_business process_ ](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Business_process).
    * Can be thought of as _"verbs"_.
* ***Dimension Table***:
    * _Dimension_ = _Context_
    * Groups of hierarchies and descriptors that define the facts.
        * Example: customer, product, etc.
    * Corresponds to a _business entity_.
    * Can be thought of as _"nouns"_.
* Dimensional Modeling is built on a [***star schema***](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Star_schema) with fact tables surrounded by dimension tables.

A good way to understand the _architecture_ of Dimensional Modeling is by drawing an analogy between dimensional modeling and a restaurant:
* Stage Area:
    * Contains the raw data.
    * Not meant to be exposed to everyone.
    * Similar to the food storage area in a restaurant.
* Processing area:
    * From raw data to data models.
    * Focuses in efficiency and ensuring standards.
    * Similar to the kitchen in a restaurant.
* Presentation area:
    * Final presentation of the data.
    * Exposure to business stakeholder.
    * Similar to the dining room in a restaurant.

# Introduction to dbt

_[Video source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eCouvVOJUw&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=35)_

## What is dbt?

***dbt*** stands for ***data build tool***. It's a _transformation_ tool: it allows us to transform process _raw_ data in our Data Warehouse to _transformed_ data which can be later used by Business Intelligence tools and any other data consumers.

![alt text](<../images/Screenshot from 2024-02-24 15-16-13.png>)

dbt also allows us to introduce good software engineering practices by defining a _deployment workflow_:
1. Develop models
1. Test and document models
1. Deploy models with _version control_ and _CI/CD_.

## How does dbt work?

dbt works by defining a ***modeling layer*** that sits on top of our Data Warehouse. The modeling layer will turn _tables_ into ***models*** which we will then transform into _derived models_, which can be then stored into the Data Warehouse for persistence.

A ***model*** is a .sql file with a `SELECT` statement; no DDL or DML is used. dbt will compile the file and run it in our Data Warehouse.

![alt text](<../images/Screenshot from 2024-02-24 15-17-36.png>)

## How to use dbt?

dbt has 2 main components: _dbt Core_ and _dbt Cloud_:
* ***dbt Core***: open-source project that allows the data transformation.
    * Builds and runs a dbt project (.sql and .yaml files).
    * Includes SQL compilation logic, macros and database adapters.
    * Includes a CLI interface to run dbt commands locally.
    * Open-source and free to use.
* ***dbt Cloud***: SaaS application to develop and manage dbt projects.
    * Web-based IDE to develop, run and test a dbt project.
    * Jobs orchestration.
    * Logging and alerting.
    * Intregrated documentation.
    * Free for individuals (one developer seat).

For integration with BigQuery we will use the dbt Cloud IDE, so a local installation of dbt core isn't required. For developing locally rather than using the Cloud IDE, dbt Core is required. Using dbt with a local Postgres database can be done with dbt Core, which can be installed locally and connected to Postgres and run models through the CLI.

## Module 4 Homework 

In this homework, we'll use the models developed during the week 4 videos and enhance the already presented dbt project using the already loaded Taxi data for fhv vehicles for year 2019 in our DWH.

This means that in this homework we use the following data [Datasets list](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/)
* Yellow taxi data - Years 2019 and 2020
* Green taxi data - Years 2019 and 2020 
* fhv data - Year 2019. 

We will use the data loaded for:

* Building a source table: `stg_fhv_tripdata`
* Building a fact table: `fact_fhv_trips`
* Create a dashboard 

If you don't have access to GCP, you can do this locally using the ingested data from your Postgres database
instead. If you have access to GCP, you don't need to do it for local Postgres - only if you want to.

> **Note**: if your answer doesn't match exactly, select the closest option 

### Question 1: 

**What happens when we execute dbt build --vars '{'is_test_run':'true'}'**
You'll need to have completed the ["Build the first dbt models"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVI30Vxzd6c) video. 
- It's the same as running *dbt build*
- It applies a _limit 100_ to all of our models
- It applies a _limit 100_ only to our staging models (**ANSWER**)
- Nothing

### Question 2: 

**What is the code that our CI job will run? Where is this code coming from?**  

- The code that has been merged into the main branch
- The code that is behind the creation object on the dbt_cloud_pr_ schema
- The code from any development branch that has been opened based on main
- The code from the development branch we are requesting to merge to main (**ANSWER**)


### Question 3 (2 points)

**What is the count of records in the model fact_fhv_trips after running all dependencies with the test run variable disabled (:false)?**  
Create a staging model for the fhv data, similar to the ones made for yellow and green data. Add an additional filter for keeping only records with pickup time in year 2019.
Do not add a deduplication step. Run this models without limits (is_test_run: false).

Create a core model similar to fact trips, but selecting from stg_fhv_tripdata and joining with dim_zones.
Similar to what we've done in fact_trips, keep only records with known pickup and dropoff locations entries for pickup and dropoff locations. 
Run the dbt model without limits (is_test_run: false).

- 12998722
- 22998722 (**ANSWER**)
- 32998722
- 42998722

### Question 4 (2 points)

**What is the service that had the most rides during the month of July 2019 month with the biggest amount of rides after building a tile for the fact_fhv_trips table?**

Create a dashboard with some tiles that you find interesting to explore the data. One tile should show the amount of trips per month, as done in the videos for fact_trips, including the fact_fhv_trips data.

- FHV
- Green
- Yellow (**ANSWER**)
- FHV and Green
